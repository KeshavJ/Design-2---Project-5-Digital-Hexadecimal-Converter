# Design-2---Project-5-Digital-Hexadecimal-Converter

The objective of this project is to design and build a microcontroller based Digital hexadecimal
converter which counts from 0 to 15 showing the 4-digit binary code and the 2-digit hexadecimal
number. The hexadecimal converter must also have start, stop and reset buttons as well as an audio
alarm which sounds when the count is at the value; 1,2,3 and 15. Furthermore, a Real-Time Clock (RTC)
must be interfaced with the microcontroller to display the current time of day when the digital
converter is not in one of its stop modes. The microcontroller used for this project is the PIC16F690.
